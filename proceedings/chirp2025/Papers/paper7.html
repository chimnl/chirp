  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Flood response planning in local communities is often hindered by fragmented communication across Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) councils. In this work, we explore how extended reality (XR) can support more effective planning through narrative-driven design. We present Routscape, an XR prototype for visualizing flood scenarios and evacuation routes, developed through iterative prototyping and user-centered design with DRRM officers. By grounding the system in real-world experiences and localized narratives, we highlight how XR can aid in fostering shared understanding and spatial sensemaking in disaster preparedness efforts.
