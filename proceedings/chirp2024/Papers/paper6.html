  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Push notifications are brief messages that users frequently encounter in their daily lives. However, the volume of notifications can lead to information overload, making it challenging for users to engage effectively. This study investigates how notification behavior and color influence user interaction and perception. To explore this, we developed an app prototype that tracks user interactions with notifications, categorizing them as accepted, dismissed, or ignored. After each interaction, users were asked to complete a survey regarding their perception of the notifications. The study focused on how different notification colors might affect the likelihood of acceptance and perceived importance. The results reveal that certain colors were more likely to be accepted and were perceived as more important compared to others, suggesting that both color and behavior play significant roles in shaping user engagement with notifications.
