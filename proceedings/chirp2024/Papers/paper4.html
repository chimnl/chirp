  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Social Virtual Reality (SVR) is a powerful medium for social interaction, enabling embodied experiences and fostering VR-native communities. As a result, SVR presents unique opportunities for Filipinos globally to reconnect with their cultural heritage and maintain their identity. In this paper, I reflect on SVR’s potential in sharing Filipino culture through a literature review and scenarios. I identify two research opportunities: sharing culture through food and community. I argue that SVR affordances, such as embodiment, presence, and user-generated content, can create meaningful experiences for Filipinos to engage with their heritage. Furthermore, I highlight the role of Filipino HCI researchers in developing culturally relevant SVR experiences and emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and community engagement. My work contributes to discussions on SVR’s potential in fostering cultural identity, social connection, and well-being among Filipinos worldwide.
