  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Smart Home Assistants (SHAs) have become ubiquitous in modern households, offering convenience and efficiency through its voice interface. However, for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals, the reliance on auditory and textual feedback through a screen poses significant challenges. Existing solutions primarily focus on sign language input but overlook the need for seamless interaction and feedback modalities. This paper envisions SHAs designed specifically for DHH users, focusing on accessibility and inclusion. We discuss integrating augmented reality (AR) for visual feedback, support for multimodal input, including sign language and gestural commands, and context awareness through sound detection. Our vision highlights the importance of considering the diverse communication needs of the DHH community in developing SHA to ensure equitable access to smart home technology.
