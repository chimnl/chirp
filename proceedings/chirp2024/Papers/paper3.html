  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Early Career Researchers (ECRs) in the Global South seek to conduct impactful and innovative research, but are lacking in support. Moreover, those who specialize in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) experience a temporal and ethical disconnect that cannot be sufficiently addressed by conventional design methods like human-centered design (HCD). Radical design methods like design futuring offer potential but demand significant time and resources, often unavailable to ECRs in the Global South. This position paper proposes leveraging generative AI to aid these ECRs in (a) envisioning possible research ideas and (b) evaluating their ethical implications. We identify an opportunity to create an AI-enabled creativity support tool for design futuring. However, we recommend first conducting an anticipatory ethnography study to understand the speculation process and AI’s influence on it, which would guide the tool’s design and development. Overall, through generative AI’s augmentation, we hope that design futuring can become central to HCI research.
