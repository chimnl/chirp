  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    This study expands Fitts’ Law into a 3D context by analyzing PointARs: a mixed reality system that teaches pointers through an object manipulation task. We explored nine distinct configurations, varying in sizes of objects and their distances from each other, to gauge task complexity through metrics such as completion time, error rate, and throughput. Our results align with Fitts’ Law in that increased distances amplify task difficulty. However, contrary to the law’s predictions, we found that tasks with larger objects also increased in complexity, possibly due to the system’s limitations in tracking larger objects. Based on our findings, we recommend to use tangible cubes that are at least 1.5” and at most 2” in size, and maintain a maximum distance of 2” for optimal interaction within the system’s 3D space. Future research should investigate additional configurations and shapes to further validate Fitts’ Law within the realm of 3D object manipulations such as that in PointARs’ context.
